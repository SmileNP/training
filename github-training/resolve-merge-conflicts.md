# Resolve Merge Conflicts

[Completed Training Repo Link](https://github.com/SmileNP/skills-resolve-merge-conflicts)

GitHub performs what is known as a *reverse merge*. This means that the changes from the `main` branch were merged into your `head` branch. With a reverse merge, only the `head` branch is updated. This allows you to test the resolved changes on your branch before you merge it into `main`.
